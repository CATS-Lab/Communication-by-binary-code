# DOE-CRC-coder
This code is to transfer trajectory/velocity information to binary code and help obtain this information. 
The algorithm is Cyclic redundancy check (CRC) to encode and decode information. 
CRC needs a initialize check code. In this code, the default initialize check code is a 8-byte code.
